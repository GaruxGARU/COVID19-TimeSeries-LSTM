# COVID-19 Time Series Prediction using LSTM

This project utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict COVID-19 time series data. The dataset is sourced from [MoH-Malaysia/covid19-public](https://github.com/MoH-Malaysia/covid19-public).

## Introduction

The main objective of this project is to create a deep learning model using LSTM neural networks to predict new COVID-19 cases (`cases_new`) in Malaysia based on the past 30 days of case data.

- The primary code is located in `TimeSeries_LSTM.ipynb`.
- Utilize `TimeSeriesWindow.py` to create a window for time series data.
